    "> Machine learning can be used to predict the age of crabs. It can be more accurate than simply weighing a crab to estimate its age. Several different models can be used, though support vector regression was found to be the most accurate in this experiment.\n",

    ">> | <br /><br />*It is quite difficult to determine a crab's age due to their molting cycles which happen throughout their whole life. Essentially, the failure to harvest at an ideal age, increases cost and crab lives go to waste.* | <br /><br />*Beyond a certain age, there is negligible growth in crab's physical characteristics and hence, it is important to time the harvesting to reduce cost and increase profit.* | <br /><br />Prepare crab data and use it to train several machine learning models. Thus, given certain physcial chraracteristics and the corresponding values, the ML models will accurately determine the age of the crabs. |\n",

    ">>>>>>\n",
    ">>>>>> Overall, the models were able to predict the age of crabs reasonably well. On average, the predictions were off by about 1.5 months. Although support vector regression performed slightly better than the other two models, it was still close enough that any of the models could be used with satisfactory results.\n",
    ">>>>>>\n",
    ">>>>>> Multiple linear regression was found to be slightly better at predicting older crabs while support vector regression was better at predicting younger crabs. K-nearest neighbor was average overall. What is important to note is that the predictions for all three models were more accurate when the age of the crab was less than 12 months. This makes sense because after a crab reaches full maturity around 12 months, its growth comes to a halt and it is harder to predict its age since its features stay roughly the same.\n",
    ">>>>>>\n",
    ">>>>>> Therefore, predicting the age of a crab becomes less accurate the longer a crab has matured. To circumvent this, the dataset could be further preprocessed so that any crab over the age of 12 months will be set to 12 months.\n",
    ">>>>>>\n",
    ">>>>>> This would greatly increase the accuracy of the machine learning models though the models would no longer be able to predict any ages over 12 months. Since the purpose is to find which crabs are harvestable, this may be a good compromise.\n",

    ">>>>>> Predicting the age of a crab becomes less accurate the longer a crab has matured. To circumvent this, the dataset could be further preprocessed so that any crab over the age of 12 months will be set to 12 months.\n",
    ">>>>>>\n",
    ">>>>>> This would greatly increase the accuracy of the machine learning models though the models would no longer be able to predict any ages over 12 months. Since the purpose is to find which crabs are harvestable, this may be a good compromise.\n",
